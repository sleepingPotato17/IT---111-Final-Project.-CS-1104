                <h3>SDG/Sustainable Development Goal 1</h3>
                <p>Sustainable Development Goal 1, or "No Poverty," aims to eradicate poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030. This ambitious goal encompasses more than just income; it addresses the lack of access to basic services like food, water, and sanitation, and the vulnerabilities created by climate change and conflict. The strategy emphasizes leaving no one behind, prioritizing those furthest from opportunity. This involves implementing social protection systems, ensuring equal access to resources like land ownership and technology, and building resilience against disasters. While progress has been made, challenges remain, particularly in light of recent setbacks like the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring the need for continued, multifaceted efforts to achieve this crucial goal.
